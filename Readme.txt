üõ†Ô∏è Service Request Management System
üìñ Overview
This project is a Service Request Management System that allows users to manage service requests using binary search trees and graph data structures. The system provides functionalities to:

‚ûï Add service requests
üóëÔ∏è Delete service requests
üîç Search service requests
üîÉ Sort service requests
üõë Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following before getting started:

‚úÖ Visual Studio 2019 or later
‚úÖ .NET Framework 4.8
üìÅ Project Structure
Here's what each file does:

ServiceRequestStatus.cs: Handles service request status functionalities.
Dashboard: Displays the dashboard page.
ReportIssues.cs: Manages the reporting of new issues.
LocalEventsForm: Allows users to search for upcoming events.
BinarySearchTree.cs: Implements a binary search tree.
Graph.cs: Implements a graph data structure.

üñ±Ô∏è How to Use the Program
1Ô∏è‚É£ Report an Issue
Click the Report Issues button on the sidebar.
Enter your location in the following format:
"Street Name, Neighbourhood, City, Area Code"
Example: "Florence, Observatory, Cape Town, 7700"
Select a category from the dropdown menu. If you choose "Other," a new text box will appear for a custom category.
Provide a detailed issue description.
Optionally, click the Attach Media button to upload an image.
Click Submit to save the report.
Optionally, view your last submitted report by clicking View Reports.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Manage Service Requests
Click the Service Request button on the sidebar. You‚Äôll see a list of all submitted reports.
Use the Sort by Priority button to organize reports, with the highest priority at the top.
Use the Refresh button to update the list after any action.
Use the ReportID textbox to input a specific Report ID.
Click Find All Related Requests to view related requests.
Click Find Closest Related Request to identify the most closely related report.
Don‚Äôt forget to click Refresh after each action!
üßÆ Data Structures Used
1Ô∏è‚É£ Binary Search Tree üå≥
The Binary Search Tree was generated using OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and is used for:

Storing and managing service requests with the key as the Report ID and the value as request details.
Performing operations such as:
Insert: Add new service requests.
TryGetValue: Retrieve service request details.
Traversal: Display service requests using in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversals.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Graph üìà
The Graph was also generated using OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and is used to:

Represent relationships between service requests (e.g., same category or location).
Perform operations like:
AddVertex: Add new service requests as vertices.
AddEdge: Create relationships between service requests.
DFS/BFS: Traverse the graph to find related requests.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Heap üóÇÔ∏è
The Heap (also generated using ChatGPT) is used to:

Sort service requests by priority. High-priority items are pushed to the top, while low-priority items remain at the bottom.
Example operations:
Insert: Add all items from the ListView into the heap.
RemoveMax: Retrieve items in priority order for display.
üìú Sample Code for Sorting with Heap
csharp
Copy code
// Initialize a heap with a custom comparison function
var heap = new Heap<ListViewItem>((item1, item2) =>
{
    int priority1 = int.Parse(item1.SubItems[4].Text);
    int priority2 = int.Parse(item2.SubItems[4].Text);
    return priority1.CompareTo(priority2);
});

// Insert all items into the heap
foreach (ListViewItem item in listViewRequests.Items)
{
    heap.Insert(item);
}

// Clear the ListView and add sorted items
listViewRequests.Items.Clear();
while (heap.Count > 0)
{
    listViewRequests.Items.Add(heap.RemoveMax());
}
